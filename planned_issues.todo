- Add basic unit class
- Add character class that inherits from unit class
- Add folders for saved characters
- Add argument 'name' when initializing character
- Look for the name in saved characters
  - if character with that name exists, load it
  - else create random character and save it
    # use default values instead of random ones for now
- Ask in the console if a character should be created if it doesn't exist
- Throw error in the setup of battle if given character doesn't exist
